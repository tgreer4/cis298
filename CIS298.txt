Course and University Policies: 
The instructor reserves the right to modify policies to improve the execution of this course.
* Announcements will be posted on Canvas. Please read your email/canvas regularly for announcements.
* Use email (RCMann@umich.edu) to message me, not Canvas.
* You are expected to submit your lab assignments by the due date/time. Late assignments will decrease their potential points every 24 hours from when due: 15%, 25%, 50%; 0 points after 72 hours late.
* If there are mistakes in grading any assignment, please contact me or your lab instructor within one week after the grade is posted. The entire work will be graded again and the new grade will replace the original one, whether the new grade is higher or lower than the original grade.
* A grade of C- or better is required in this course in order to take any future CIS courses.
* If you need a B or A or whatever to maintain your scholarship or stay in the country or any other reason, then you'd better work hard to ensure you achieve that grade.	 Requests for final grade improvements will reduce your final course grade by 2 points.
* Don't ask for extra credit. If you're doing the work you won't need it
